# Deep-Learning-Framework

Custom deep-learning framework developed using python, but can be converted to other languages.

Current Stuff:

1: Dense Layer
2: Activation Function
3: Confusion Matrix
4: Boostrap Algorithm

Future Stuff:

1: Backpropagation
2: Loss Functions, Optimzers, Metrics, etc.
3: Convolution and Pooling
4: Generative Adversary 

Currently only capable of supervised stuff with labels in the MLP kernel. Unsupervised coming by December hopefully.
